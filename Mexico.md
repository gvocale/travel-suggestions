#LIST TO DO – MEXICO

Welcome to Mexico, it’s not as dangerous as they say, but it’s not as safe as you’d like.
So, just try to stay in the “cool” areas, and when you are in other neighborhoods, try to walk the streets where you see more people.

Y#OU CAN UBER VERY EASILY WITH YOUR SAME ACCOUNT AND IT’S SAFE!

The safest neighborhoods are:
1. Roma (it’s the chic neighborhood now, lots of little restaurants, cafes, a bit expensive)
2. Condesa (It’s the Roma from a few years ago, it’s also really nice and feels safer)
3. Polanco (poshy area, usually very busy, lots of traffic)
4. Nápoles (not too much to see, there’s the Poliforum-Siqueiros, but you can skip that one)
5. Santa María la Ribera (it’s getting there, not super safe but it’s pintoresque)
6. Coyoacán (far south of the city, but if you go to the South, you can take advantage and visit some places, it’s a nice area)
7. Historic center (I explain below, it’s not the safest place, but it’s okay, it’s usually very crowded but there are beautiful buildings, go in the daytime. It’s a must!)

## Some places to go

### Teotihuacán
Pyramid ruins, very nice place, very touristic but it’s worth it. It’s far from the city so you need to take a special bus or have a driver. I really like this place, bring sunscreen and a hat because you won’t find any shade in the whole place and sun in Mexico can get intense. Bring comfortable shoes and try to climb the 2 big pyramids, really fun.

### Chapultepec
It’s kind of our version of Central Park. It has a lake and a zoo, and a beautiful castle “Castillo de Chapultepec” (try to go to the castle, it has a beautiful view of the city and it’s beautiful). Chapultepec gets REALLY busy during the weekends, and it can be overwhelming, try to go during the weekdays. They DON’T open on Mondays. The Museo de Antropología is across the street so you can walk around.

### National Museum of Anthropolgy
A must! It’s very close to Polanco.

### Historic Center (Centro Histórico)
It’s a must. You have to go to have breakfast to a place called “El Cardenal” http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150800-d814867-Reviews-Restaurante_El_Cardenal-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html) They have amazing Mexican food and fresh bread in the mornings with hot chocolate!
Then you have to walk around the area, the main pedestrian street is called Francisco I. Madero, you can walk there and it brings you to:
- Zócalo, which is a really big plaza where people gather to celebrate big dates.
- Mexican Cathedral, beautiful, take a look. It’s accross the street of Zocalo.
- Templo Mayor, two blocks from there, it’s a museum with some ruins. In the plaza you will see a lor pre-Hispanic Aztec dancing.
- Bellas Artes, it’s a MUST! go inside and see the murals (marble is so heavy that it keeps sinking every year). The murals here are unbelievable, there are not many but you can watch them for a long time. You will also see here the controversial mural that Diego Rivera did in NY in the Rockefeller Center, which was forbidden because he was getting too many communist things there. It’s very interesting. There a screen that explains the murals in one of the walls, I do prefer to google while I sit in front of them. You first have to make a line to buy the tickets and then a line to get in, but it moves pretty fast.

### Secretaría de Educación Pública (Secretary of Public Education)
If you want to see more of Diego Rivera in a calm and beautiful building, go here and tell them you want to come in. All the walls of the whole building is full of murals.

### Former College of San Ildefonso
Beautiful building https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150800-d152765-Reviews-Antiguo_Colegio_de_San_Ildefonso-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html

### Xochimilco
A very Mexican experience, but to be honest, it’s worth if you are a big group of people and you have a driver to bring you (it’s very far south in the city). Just take a “trajinera” (little boats) and enjoy the ride, you can buy some food on the water from vendors that will SURELY approach you (eat some corn on the cob as they prepare it, maybe not the spicy powder if you don’t like spicy). See the mariachis, but if you bring them too close, you will have to pay and it’s not cheap. Tell your guide to advice you on this. Usually you have to pay around $350-$400 pesos per hour. Take an Uber there, it’s too far.

### Dolores Olmedo Museum
If you’re interested on seeing more of Frida and Diego (her husband, one of the most famous painters of Mexico), you can go to this museum. Dolores Olmedo was a very rich lady that made quite a collection of their work. Please notice that most of Frida work is on tour at the moment. The house is beautiful, try to do it the same day of Xochimilco, they are in the same area.

### Coyoacán
I already mentioned it before, it’s not as far, but it’s south of the city. It’s a nice walk and nice things to eat. Go to El Mercado de Coyoacán and eat like a real Mexican, it looks dirty but it’s actually good. Some tips here:

### Frida Kahlo Museum
In Coyoacán, it’s a beautiful house, Frida and Diego used to live here. You MUST reserve to go here and secure tickets. It’s highly recommended, especially with all the Frida Kahlo international love. Walk around the neighborhood, it’s a beautiful part of the city, safe and walkable.
Buy tickets here, no need for a tour guide, just buy the audio guide, it’s good. https://www.museofridakahlo.org.mx/en/the-blue-house/your-visit/

Maybe one of the most popular places, if you eat seafood, you’ll like this (order tuna tostadas to start and the two sauces fish) Try to make a Reservation. http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150800-d813752-Reviews-Contramar-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html

They have exactly the same menu of Contramar, but it’s less lively.

#### Rosetta Restaurant
It’s a good match between Italian and Mexican food, it’s very good. Make a RESERVATION. There’s also a Rosetta Panadería which you can go as well, but it’s more sandwiches and good bread, go to the restaurant instead. https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150800-d2282541-Reviews-Rosetta-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html

#### Rosetta Bakery
#### Café Nin
Are two beautiful cafes with almost the same menu, bread is amazing!!!  Try the rosemarie bread (bollo de romero), it’s very small, order 5!!!

#### “La casa de Toño”
Pozoles in Santa María la Ribera neighborhood. It’s a good excuse to go to this neighborhood and eat in a great traditional place (go with the driver because the area is not the safest). Then you walk to this little park:

Pozole is a traditional food in Mexico, it’s a soup-ish with hominy and meat (usually pork, but it can be chicken or even vegetarian). The top it with some garnishes. In this place, you can also order “quesadillas”, they are very good and very close to what you’d eat on the street.

#### Maque
The sweet bread of Mexico is amazing. “Conchas” are the most traditional and they are amazing here, but all of them are good.  In this place you can have a nice hot chocolate and bread (the best combination). They also have breaksfast and the place is really nice (but small).

This is how Mexican sweet bread looks like:


There are other local “panaderías” (bakeries) if you guys walk by and want to try something there:

### Other things to visit

#### Avenida Reforma, walk this avenue, there is the most beautiful avenue in Mexico, there are sculptures in roundabouts, some little sculptures on the street, and a lot of art. it’s a REALLY nice walk! On Sundays, they close the traffic of the street, so people can bike and walk. They only close it from 8am to 2pm, but it’s nice to go there and walk.
One example of roundabout:

#### Monumento a la Revolución (Revolution Monument). It’s close to Reforma and it’s a very nice little area.
