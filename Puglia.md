# Puglia

Puglia has 6 provinces / districts

1. [Bari](#bari) (BA) 
2. [Barletta-Andria-Trani](#barletta) (BT)
3. Brindisi (BR)
4. [Foggia](#foggia) (FG)
5. [Lecce](#lecce) (LE)
6. Taranto (TA)

The ones attracting more turisms are Lecce and Bari.
Barletta-Andria-Trani is very close to Bari and it has some interesting towns.
Foggia is much less popular. 
I would skip Taranto and Brindisi for now, they have large ports and factories there.

## Bari

Since Bari and Barletta, Andri, Trani are all pretty close, I'll bundle them all together.

### Local Food

**Stracciatella**
Stracciatella is another cheese from around Bari. Very milky. It’s like eating just the creamy inside of a Burrata.
This is among my n.1 favorite mozzarella-like cheese. Find it in local grocery stores, or even try to find a local Caseificio producing it.

It is originally from *Andria*, but can be purchased everywhere in Puglia.

**Focaccia Barese**
Usually deep-dish and with cherry tomatoes. Good for a snacking. Traditional from *Bari*.

**Orecchiette alle cime di rape**
Traditional ear drup shaped pasta with rabe and spicy pepper. Traditional from *Bari*.

**Burrata**
Burrata is another creamy soft mozzarella from *Andria*. You should be able to find it easily in grocery stores.

**Coratina Olive oil**
The *Coratina* variety of olive oil is from *Corato* (near Bari). It is a very pungent, strong oil. Often the mix Coratina with other more blend variety, cause Coratina by itself is so spicy. Coratina is probably my favorite olive oil. Sometimes you’d be able to spot some “Oleificio” sign outside towns. There are some around Bari’s airport. Oleificio are the factories where they make olive oils. Usually oil is produced in November though, so Oleificio’s may have sold already all the oil they had. But anyway if you’re going to buy oil, look for local, made in Puglia, olive oil, possibly of Coratina variety.

**Mozzarelle**
Plenty of local mozzarella’s brand to try. I used to love _Del Giudice_, but also _Silac_ and other local brands are all good.

**Pane casereccio**
Local bread. Usually large loaf of white bread, salty, with lots of hair inside

**Tarallo**
This is kind of a local bread-y snack. I like salty ones. They are from around Bari. They’re great poached into white wine.

**Wine**
Puglia produces lots of medium quality wine. Usually OEM wine used to cut other wines. The local premium ones are usually very dry and strong (they say because of the heat).
When drinking instead table wines, cheaper, are lighter and easier to drink. Wine is cheap and there should be plenty.


**Fresh / Raw Seafood**
Around _Bari_ they love raw seafood. Some of it illegal to fish (the one in risk of extinction), some restaurant may serve several kind of row crustaceum. Probably you can find them as well near the fishing boats in the harbor.
Normal ones include mussels, various kind of clams, sea urchins, shrimps, etc…
Watchout eating raw ones, cause if you didn’t eat them before your body may not be ready and may get fever (happened to me). Cooked is fine.

**Seafood**
There’s plenty of local seafood all around beach towns. Just go for local, seasonal seafood. Should be all fresh. If you want to cook your own, head to the small port downtown of _Trani_ or other nearby costal town, usually at sunset. Around sunset local fishing boat return with the fresh catch of the day and sell the fish as it gets unloaded from the boat.

**Salsiccia / Sausage**
Usually skinny and salty, with fennel seeds. Pretty lean.

**Riso, patate e cozze**
Rice, potatoes and muscles. Typical main dish from _Bari_.

### Towns to visit

**Locorotondo (Valle d’Itria)**
Little town on running hills. The countryside around Locorotondo is called Valle d’Itria and is very iconic. All pieces of land are small and irregular. There are lots of Trulli, which are old traditional houses in a shape of a cone. You can even try to sleep in one of them.
They recommended us the restaurant Lu Curdunn http://www.ristoranteucurdunn.it/ for some traditional meals. We went for dinner and liked it.
A friend of mine, Andrea Pisante, slept in this Trullo https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2979505.  He played in a folk band called Riso Patate ‘n’ Folk and stayed there at least 3 times. There is a garden with a cherry tree and around there there are some mozzarella factories (caseifici).

**Alberobello**
Iconic town with lots of _Trulli_ (buildings shaped like cones).

**Castel Del Monte**
Iconic castle shaped as octagon

**Trani**
White old church downtown around the port

**Polignano a mare**
This town has a little beach / inlet where to swim right next to the old town. Pretty iconic. Nice picture shot. You could walk around the old town. Me and Giselle spent 2 hrs here, just took photo and left.
Friends recommended restaurant Osteria il Mulino, order carpaccio (raw / cevice) of octopus , white wine.

**Grotte di Castellana**
Caves


## Lecce
This is the largest city in _Salento_ (the Southeast province in Puglia). There is plenty of nightlife. Lots of airbnb to choose from.

### Towns to visit

**Ostuni**
Nice old town. The white city.

**Martina Franca**
Similar to Locorotondo, clean a nice old town. There is more nightlife then Locorotondo. Friends recommended restaurant Osteria Garibaldi. Me and Giselle didn’t make it there. I’ve been when I was young, but don’t remember much.

**Matera**
This is 2 hours from Locorotondo. It is a yellow looking old town and houses are build in the rocks. Friends told me tit is very nice to stay at night, cause everything is in yellow light. Me and Giselle didn’t go because it was a little bit out of the route we were doing. I’ve been there in other occasions but never at night.

**Gallipoli**
This is the main spot for nightlife. Few clubs, bars in town. Nice to walk around. It is usually pretty busy in the summer.

**Santa Maria di Leuca**
This is the bottom tip of Puglia. Small town on the beach, can have a walk around.

**Porto Cesareo**
Town with some shops and not too bad beach

**Santa Cesarea Terme**
City with some roman old pools on the water where to bath

**Otranto**
Some nightlife

**Monopoli**
We didn’t see the city, which is supposed to be a little nice white old town, but went straight to the beach.
We went to Spiaggia Santo Stefano. It is next to a monastery and it was PACKED (we were there in August though). Locals were more on the rowdy side, but it was a very interesting people watch activity to see what’s a true towny local like when goes to the beach.

**Giovinazzo**
Fisherman’s town. Nice old town, romantic. We skipped it.


### Beaches

**Torre Guaceto**
I think this was the beach that we really liked, but I’m not 100% sure. Can’t manage to find the name. It was moderately busy and very calm shallow water.

**Punta della Suina**
Rocky beach, it was pretty busy when we went

**Canale Del Ciolo**
Little rocky inlet where you can swim. They say sunrise is nice there because it aligns with the inlet. We did sleep in a nearby airbnb (in Gagliano del Capo I think), but we didn’t make it for sunrise. Just went there for a swim.

**Torre Mozza**
Sandy beach

**Pescoluse**
Known as _Maldives of Salento_, Sandy beach, can’t remember if we stopped there or not

**Torre Colimena and nearby Salina Dei Monaci**
Two sandy beaches, not busy. There is a small bay with pink flamingos

**Torre dell’Orso**

**Laghi Alimini**

**Punta Prosciutto**
Sandy beach

**Grotta Zinzulusa**
Some cave to explore (hiking / walking tour) 1-2hrs

**Baia dei Turchi**
Beach

**Torre Dell’Orso**
Beach
