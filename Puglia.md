# Puglia

Puglia has 6 provinces / districts

1. [Bari](#bari) (BA) 
2. [Barletta-Andria-Trani](#barletta) (BT)
3. Brindisi (BR)
4. [Foggia](#foggia) (FG)
5. [Lecce](#lecce) (LE)
6. Taranto (TA)

The ones attracting more turisms are Lecce and Bari.
Barletta-Andria-Trani is very close to Bari and it has some interesting towns.
Foggia is much less popular. 
I would skip Taranto and Brindisi for now, they have large ports and factories there.

## Bari

Since Bari and Barletta, Andri, Trani are all pretty close, I'll bundle them all together.

### Local Food

**Stracciatella**
Stracciatella is another cheese from around Bari. Very milky. It’s like eating just the creamy inside of a Burrata.
This is among my n.1 favorite mozzarella-like cheese. Find it in local grocery stores, or even try to find a local Caseificio producing it.

It is originally from *Andria*, but can be purchased everywhere in Puglia.

**Focaccia Barese**
Usually deep-dish and with cherry tomatoes. Good for a snacking. Traditional from *Bari*.

**Orecchiette alle cime di rape**
Traditional ear drup shaped pasta with rabe and spicy pepper. Traditional from *Bari*.

**Burrata**
Burrata is another creamy soft mozzarella from *Andria*. You should be able to find it easily in grocery stores.

**Coratina Olive oil**
The *Coratina* variety of olive oil is from *Corato* (near Bari). It is a very pungent, strong oil. Often the mix Coratina with other more blend variety, cause Coratina by itself is so spicy. Coratina is probably my favorite olive oil. Sometimes you’d be able to spot some “Oleificio” sign outside towns. There are some around Bari’s airport. Oleificio are the factories where they make olive oils. Usually oil is produced in November though, so Oleificio’s may have sold already all the oil they had. But anyway if you’re going to buy oil, look for local, made in Puglia, olive oil, possibly of Coratina variety.

**Mozzarelle**
Plenty of local mozzarella’s brand to try. I used to love _Del Giudice_, but also _Silac_ and other local brands are all good.

**Pane casereccio**
Local bread. Usually large loaf of white bread, salty, with lots of hair inside

**Tarallo**
This is kind of a local bread-y snack. I like salty ones. They are from around Bari. They’re great poached into white wine.

**Wine**
Puglia produces lots of medium quality wine. Usually OEM wine used to cut other wines. The local premium ones are usually very dry and strong (they say because of the heat).
When drinking instead table wines, cheaper, are lighter and easier to drink. Wine is cheap and there should be plenty.


**Fresh / Raw Seafood**
Around _Bari_ they love raw seafood. Some of it illegal to fish (the one in risk of extinction), some restaurant may serve several kind of row crustaceum. Probably you can find them as well near the fishing boats in the harbor.
Normal ones include mussels, various kind of clams, sea urchins, shrimps, etc…
Watchout eating raw ones, cause if you didn’t eat them before your body may not be ready and may get fever (happened to me). Cooked is fine.

**Seafood**
There’s plenty of local seafood all around beach towns. Just go for local, seasonal seafood. Should be all fresh. If you want to cook your own, head to the small port downtown of _Trani_ or other nearby costal town, usually at sunset. Around sunset local fishing boat return with the fresh catch of the day and sell the fish as it gets unloaded from the boat.

**Salsiccia / Sausage**
Usually skinny and salty, with fennel seeds. Pretty lean.

**Riso, patate e cozze**
Rice, potatoes and muscles. Typical main dish from _Bari_.

### Towns to visit

**Locorotondo (Valle d’Itria)**
Little town on running hills. The countryside around Locorotondo is called Valle d’Itria and is very iconic. All pieces of land are small and irregular. There are lots of Trulli, which are old traditional houses in a shape of a cone. You can even try to sleep in one of them.
They recommended us the restaurant Lu Curdunn http://www.ristoranteucurdunn.it/ for some traditional meals. We went for dinner and liked it.
A friend of mine, Andrea Pisante, slept in this Trullo https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2979505.  He played in a folk band called Riso Patate ‘n’ Folk and stayed there at least 3 times. There is a garden with a cherry tree and around there there are some mozzarella factories (caseifici).

**Alberobello**
Iconic town with lots of _Trulli_ (buildings shaped like cones).

**Castel Del Monte**
Iconic castle shaped as octagon

**Trani**
White old church downtown around the port

**Polignano a mare**
This town has a little beach / inlet where to swim right next to the old town. Pretty iconic. Nice picture shot. You could walk around the old town. Me and Giselle spent 2 hrs here, just took photo and left.
Friends recommended restaurant Osteria il Mulino, order carpaccio (raw / cevice) of octopus , white wine.

**Grotte di Castellana**
Caves


## Lecce
This is the largest city in _Salento_ (the Southeast province in Puglia). There is plenty of nightlife. Lots of airbnb to choose from.

### Towns to visit

**Ostuni**
Nice old town. The white city.

**Martina Franca**
Similar to Locorotondo, clean a nice old town. There is more nightlife then Locorotondo. Friends recommended restaurant Osteria Garibaldi. Me and Giselle didn’t make it there. I’ve been when I was young, but don’t remember much.

**Matera**
This is 2 hours from Locorotondo. It is a yellow looking old town and houses are build in the rocks. Friends told me tit is very nice to stay at night, cause everything is in yellow light. Me and Giselle didn’t go because it was a little bit out of the route we were doing. I’ve been there in other occasions but never at night.

**Gallipoli**
This is the main spot for nightlife. Few clubs, bars in town. Nice to walk around. It is usually pretty busy in the summer.

**Santa Maria di Leuca**
This is the bottom tip of Puglia. Small town on the beach, can have a walk around.

**Porto Cesareo**
Town with some shops and not too bad beach

**Santa Cesarea Terme**
City with some roman old pools on the water where to bath
https://www.guesthousesalento.com/it/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GOPR7818-1170x578.jpg

**Otranto**
Some nightlife

**Monopoli**
We didn’t see the city, which is supposed to be a little nice white old town, but went straight to the beach.
We went to Spiaggia Santo Stefano. It is next to a monastery and it was PACKED (we were there in August though). Locals were more on the rowdy side, but it was a very interesting people watch activity to see what’s a true towny local like when goes to the beach.

**Giovinazzo**
Fisherman’s town. Nice old town, romantic. We skipped it.


### Beaches

**Torre Guaceto**
I think this was the beach that we really liked, but I’m not 100% sure. Can’t manage to find the name. It was moderately busy and very calm shallow water.

**Punta della Suina**
Rocky beach, it was pretty busy when we went

**Canale Del Ciolo**
Little rocky inlet where you can swim. They say sunrise is nice there because it aligns with the inlet. We did sleep in a nearby airbnb (in Gagliano del Capo I think), but we didn’t make it for sunrise. Just went there for a swim.

**Torre Mozza**
Sandy beach

**Pescoluse**
Known as _Maldives of Salento_, Sandy beach, can’t remember if we stopped there or not

**Torre Colimena and nearby Salina Dei Monaci**
Two sandy beaches, not busy. There is a small bay with pink flamingos

**Torre dell’Orso**

**Laghi Alimini**

**Punta Prosciutto**
Sandy beach

**Grotta Zinzulusa**
Some cave to explore (hiking / walking tour) 1-2hrs

**Baia dei Turchi**
Beach

**Torre Dell’Orso**
Beach


## Foggia

Foggia itself is pretty ugly. The part to see is _Gargano_, which comprise of a small mountain, two lakes, an island and few beach towns.

### Sights

**Isole Tremiti**
Rating: 5/5
Little islands that can be reached from Termoli, Rodi, Torre Mileto, Peschici, Vieste. You could spend 1~3 days there. It is very calm at night, barely any car driving around. You could do a day boat tour, so that you can visit the varius little creek around the island. I like it because it is very peaceful. It is only 1 km large, so depending on the direction the wind is blowing, you can walk and go swim on the other side. There is only 1 busy beach, the rest are little creeks (calette) which needs a bit of a hike to get to.

**Lesina**
Rating 1/5
Little town on a lake. Can spend an hour or two there. There is little foot path going from the town into the lake for a 100mt or so.

**Torre Mileto**
Rating 1/5
Little fisherman village. Not much to see here too. There is a quiet beach, not very busy. I used to spend summers on that beach when I was an infant, but as an adult I rarely went there.
From Torre Mileto to Vieste it is a pretty nice ride. Get out of the highway before Torre Mileto and from there onwards drive into smaller sea side roads.

**Capoiale**
Rating 1/5
Little fisherman village. There should be quiet beaches here too, but I haven't really been there in ages.

**Istmo di Varano**
Rating 2/5
Thin piece of land between a lake and the sea. Pretty deserted beach as well. I used to often go to the beach. There would be like 30 people on the beach. My parents used to park the car at Ristorante Albergo Isola Varano (https://goo.gl/maps/zLgsw7bRhkr), and walk to the beach through a path in the pine grove. They had some peakoks there as well in some cages, so we used to call it "Al pavone".
The people running the hotel also were selling house made mozzarellas, local grown vegetables, some lake or farm grown fish. The beach is very queit, no bath houses. There are some campings and hotel along that same road, they may rent some umbrellas on the beach, otherwise we just used to bring ours. I remember the beach being a bit dirty of plastic and other trash from the sea.

**Lido del sole**
Rating 2/5
Little town on the beach. Some campings. A little acquapark. No too much to do, could just stop for an icecream.

**Carpino**
Rating 2/5
Litte town on the hill. They have a folk festival (Carpino Folk Festival) between 6/11 August. If you're around those dates, may be worth to visit in the evening. The folk festival attracts a young crowd.

**Rodi Garganico**
Rating 3/5
I spent here some summers when I was a teenager. We would stay at Lido Cicco a Mare, cause it was close to our house, and hang out at Lido Nautilus. Now it changed quite a bit because they built a little harbor for turist boats. The town is ok to have a walk at night in the old center. North of the town there are some campings that probably have access to some nicer beaches (Lido Ponente, Hotel Baia Santa Barbara, a private resort), as opposed to the ones just near the harbour.

**San Menaio**
Rating 3/5
I used to hang out here a lot. There are few bathhouses in San Menaio and some camping villages. Me and my friends would walk towards Spiaggia dei Cento Scalini o delle Tufare, so that there would be less older people, younger people and maybe some nudist :P Sometimes we camped on the beach at night, then in the morning we'll eat some fresh cornetti made by Panificio delle Fave

**Baia Calenella**
Rating 3/5
This beach is a bit younger and may have some more educated folks or italian turists, possibly staying at the nearby camping calenella. If you're looking for a bit of a nicer beach with less locals and more well behaved turists. Then Baia Calenella is ok. Rodi and San Menaio will instead have more local folks from the nearby town, so expect a more peasant crowd :)

**Vico Garganico**
Rating 3/5
Nice little town few kilometers inland from San Menaio. Nice to have a walk there in the evening. It has little streets and hopefully some local street fair. Stop for an icecream or pastry at Bar Gelateria Pizzicato.

**Foresta Umbra**
Rating 3/5
If you feel like a walk, little hike, drive a bit inland into Parco Nazionale del Gargano, to the visitor center of Foresta Umbra. There is a little lake and some sort of easy hikes. Good to have a break from the mid day heat, take a nap under pine trees and eat some panini bought in a local alimentari in a nearby town.

**Peschici**
Rating 4/5
Nice white town on the sea. You can have a walk at night through the old town. It is a bit more lively and attract more turism then Rodi. There is a sandy beach at the feet of the town with many bath houses. It will definitively be more busy.

**Baia San Nicola (Peschici)**
Rating 4/5
Large popular beach.

**Spiggia di Zaiana / Baia Zaiana (Peschici)**
Rating 5/5
Nice little sandy beach (https://goo.gl/maps/yf3hxg7ZxUs). It attracts a younger crowd. There is a little simple restaurant on the beach cooking seafood pasta and such.

**Ristorante il Trabucco (Peschici)**
Rating 4/5
https://goo.gl/maps/qEQW4zCzTK62
There are three restaurant on Trabucco (old fisherman wood house on the water). One of the two is supposed to be a bit more posh and catering to a younger crowd. I'm not sure if it's this one, or Al Trabucco da Mimi, or Trabucco la Punta.

**Cala dei Turchi (Peschici)**
Rating 4/5
Not sure about this beach. I think I've never been.

**Spiaggia di Manacore (Peschici)**
Rating 5/5
White sandy beach, busy, with few campings accessing it.

**Peschici to Vieste**
There are several beaches between the two town. I mostly stopped before Peschici, because otherwise it would be more then 2 hours drive from my town. The general consensus is Vieste is the nicest one and the beaches around Vieste are nicer / posher. Not sure, as I rarely did go.

**Vieste**
Rating 4/5**
Larger the San Menaio, more to do for turists. I think it has a club as well. I rarely spent time there, but I usually heard it is the nicest part of Gargano, for turists.

**Pugnochiuso**
Rating 5/5
Supposed to have a nice beach. Not sure, I don't recall having been there.

**Spiaggia di Vignanotica**
Rating 5/5
My sister said it is a good white beach. Haven't been myself.

**Hotel Baia delle Zagare**
Rating 5/5
Supposed to be nice and posh. Never been there. Supposedly they have an elevator bringing from the hotel resort to the private beach https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQhCCxuITgM

**Mattinata**
Rating 4/5
Beach town south of Gargano. I've heard is nice, I barely have any memory of it.

**Monte Sant'Angelo**
Rating 3/5
Old town on the Gargano mountain. Nice to have a stroll through the old center. The Sanctuary (old church) is built into a cavern.

**San Giovanni Rotondo**
Rating 2/5
Here's the old Church of Padre Pio, and the new church built by Renzo Piano, one of the largest in the world. Could be ok to stop if anyone in the group is a follower of Padre Pio. Otherwise not much to see.
