# Gargano


## Lesina
1 *
Little town on a lake. Can spend an hour or two there. There is little foot path going from the town into the lake for a 100mt or so.


## Isole Tremiti
5 *****
Little islands that can be reached from Termoli, Rodi, Torre Mileto, Peschici, Vieste. You could spend 1~3 days there. It is very calm at night, barely any car driving around. You could do a day boat tour, so that you can visit the varius little creek around the island. I like it because it is very peaceful. It is only 1 km large, so depending on the direction the wind is blowing, you can walk and go swim on the other side. There is only 1 busy beach, the rest are little creeks (calette) which needs a bit of a hike to get to.


## Torre Mileto
1 *
Little fisherman village. Not much to see here too. There is a quiet beach, not very busy. I used to spend summers on that beach when I was an infant, but as an adult I rarely went there.
From Torre Mileto to Vieste it is a pretty nice ride. Get out of the highway before Torre Mileto and from there onwards drive into smaller sea side roads.


## Capoiale
1 *
Little fisherman village. There should be quiet beaches here too, but I haven't really been there in ages.


## Istmo di Varano
2 **
Thin piece of land between a lake and the sea. Pretty deserted beach as well. I used to often go to the beach. There would be like 30 people on the beach. My parents used to park the car at Ristorante Albergo Isola Varano (https://goo.gl/maps/zLgsw7bRhkr), and walk to the beach through a path in the pine grove. They had some peakoks there as well in some cages, so we used to call it "Al pavone".
The people running the hotel also were selling house made mozzarellas, local grown vegetables, some lake or farm grown fish. The beach is very queit, no bath houses. There are some campings and hotel along that same road, they may rent some umbrellas on the beach, otherwise we just used to bring ours. I remember the beach being a bit dirty of plastic and other trash from the sea.


## Lido del sole
2 **
Little town on the beach. Some campings. A little acquapark. No too much to do, could just stop for an icecream.


## Carpino
2 **
Litte town on the hill. They have a folk festival (Carpino Folk Festival) between 6/11 August. If you're around those dates, may be worth to visit in the evening. The folk festival attracts a young crowd.


## Rodi Garganico
3 ***
I spent here some summers when I was a teenager. We would stay at Lido Cicco a Mare, cause it was close to our house, and hang out at Lido Nautilus. Now it changed quite a bit because they built a little harbor for turist boats. The town is ok to have a walk at night in the old center. North of the town there are some campings that probably have access to some nicer beaches (Lido Ponente, Hotel Baia Santa Barbara, a private resort), as opposed to the ones just near the harbour.

## San Menaio
3 ***
I used to hang out here a lot. There are few bathhouses in San Menaio and some camping villages. Me and my friends would walk towards Spiaggia dei Cento Scalini o delle Tufare, so that there would be less older people, younger people and maybe some nudist :P Sometimes we camped on the beach at night, then in the morning we'll eat some fresh cornetti made by Panificio delle Fave

## Baia Calenella
3 ***
This beach is a bit younger and may have some more educated folks or italian turists, possibly staying at the nearby camping calenella. If you're looking for a bit of a nicer beach with less locals and more well behaved turists. Then Baia Calenella is ok. Rodi and San Menaio will instead have more local folks from the nearby town, so expect a more peasant crowd :)

## Vico Garganico
3 ***
Nice little town few kilometers inland from San Menaio. Nice to have a walk there in the evening. It has little streets and hopefully some local street fair. Stop for an icecream or pastry at Bar Gelateria Pizzicato.

## Foresta Umbra
3 ***
If you feel like a walk, little hike, drive a bit inland into Parco Nazionale del Gargano, to the visitor center of Foresta Umbra. There is a little lake and some sort of easy hikes. Good to have a break from the mid day heat, take a nap under pine trees and eat some panini bought in a local alimentari in a nearby town.

## Peschici
4 ****
Nice white town on the sea. You can have a walk at night through the old town. It is a bit more lively and attract more turism then Rodi. There is a sandy beach at the feet of the town with many bath houses. It will definitively be more busy.

## Baia San Nicola (Peschici)
4 ****
Large popular beach.

## Spiggia di Zaiana / Baia Zaiana (Peschici)
5 *****
Nice little sandy beach (https://goo.gl/maps/yf3hxg7ZxUs). It attracts a younger crowd. There is a little simple restaurant on the beach cooking seafood pasta and such.

## Ristorante il Trabucco (Peschici)
4 ****
https://goo.gl/maps/qEQW4zCzTK62
There are three restaurant on Trabucco (old fisherman wood house on the water). One of the two is supposed to be a bit more posh and catering to a younger crowd. I'm not sure if it's this one, or Al Trabucco da Mimi, or Trabucco la Punta.

## Cala dei Turchi (Peschici)
4 ****
Not sure about this beach. I think I've never been.

## Spiaggia di Manacore (Peschici)
5 *****
White sandy beach, busy, with few campings accessing it.

## Peschici to Vieste
There are several beaches between the two town. I mostly stopped before Peschici, because otherwise it would be more then 2 hours drive from my town. The general consensus is Vieste is the nicest one and the beaches around Vieste are nicer / posher. Not sure, as I rarely did go.

## Vieste
4 ******
Larger the San Menaio, more to do for turists. I think it has a club as well. I rarely spent time there, but I usually heard it is the nicest part of Gargano, for turists.

## Pugnochiuso
5 *****
Supposed to have a nice beach. Not sure, I don't recall having been there.

## Spiaggia di Vignanotica
5 *****
My sister said it is a good white beach. Haven't been myself.

## Hotel Baia delle Zagare
5 *****
Supposed to be nice and posh. Never been there. Supposedly they have an elevator bringing from the hotel resort to the private beach https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQhCCxuITgM


## Mattinata
4 ****
Beach town south of Gargano. I've heard is nice, I barely have any memory of it.

## Monte Sant'Angelo
3 ***
Old town on the Gargano mountain. Nice to have a stroll through the old center. The Sanctuary (old church) is built into a cavern.

## San Giovanni Rotondo
2 **
Here's the old Church of Padre Pio, and the new church built by Renzo Piano, one of the largest in the world. Could be ok to stop if anyone in the group is a follower of Padre Pio. Otherwise not much to see.
