## Cascate del Mulino (Manciano)
Free thermal bath, we didn't stop.

## Bagni San Filippo, Il fosso bianco
Thermal bath in the nature with calcium formations. We just stopped for a walk.

## Bagno Vignoni (thermal bath)
Small village with an old big thermal pool. We stopped for ham, cheese and wine at La Bottega di Cacio (https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g668220-d1876873-Reviews-La_Bottega_Di_Cacio-Bagno_Vignoni_Tuscany.html) and enjoyed our meal.

## Fortrezza di Radicofani
Castle, we didn't go

----

## Montepulciano
Nice little town we walked around at night. I had a big florentine steak at Osteria Acquacheta and was pretty good. We also tried some truffle pasta, but didn't smell of truffles at all. Maybe real truffles are just much less strong than truffle oil or pastes.

## Florence
We stayed in an airbnb in San Frediano neighbourhood, which is supposed to be the most hipster one. Lots of nice restaurant and some vintage shopping (although mostly expensive and selected items).
- Visited Santa Croce, duomo
- Ponte vecchio
- Mercato di Sant’Ambrogio (antiques)
- Borgo degli Albizi ­
- There are some larger flea markets like Le Cascine market at Le Cascine Park every Tuesday from 7am to 2pm. We didn't go.
- The city’s flea market has now been moved to Largo Pietro Annigoni, and takes place every day but Sunday

- Oltrarno neighborhood

## Flea markets
- [x] Mercato Centrale in the San Lorenzo Neighborhood, open daily until around 2pm. An institution of a place, with vendors hawking all sorts of products, from fish to exotic fruits. Upstairs you will find the fancy food court I adore which makes this area even more awesome!
- The city’s flea market has now been moved to Largo Pietro Annigoni, and takes place every day but Sunday
- Le Cascine market at Le Cascine Park every Tuesday from 7am to 2pm. 


## Food raccomandation we didn't try 
- Il Santo Graal, Via Romana, 70R. Tradition meets innovative
- Alla Vecchia Bettola, Viale Vasco Pratolini 3-5-7. (Piazza Tasso area). Great meat dishes and pasta, I would make reservations as the interior isn’t very big. 
- ‘O Munaciello, Via Maffia, 31. They are known for napolitano pizza and seafood – don’t forget to make a reservation!
- Osteria de L’Ortolano - Nice Dinner spot - the place may look like a take-away deli, but they have a room in the back for lunch & dinner.
- Check Hangar pub
- Il Chicco di Caffè, Via della Chiesa 16r (not far from Piazza Santo Spirito).
- Gusta Pizza, Via Maggio, 46r. Small tiny joint close to Piazza Santo Spirito (cheap pizza and wine)
- La Casalinga, Via dè Michelozzi, 9R. Next to Gusta Pizza – affordable and yummy traditional Tuscan trattoria. Make reservations and enjoy the house wine, I really like this place.
