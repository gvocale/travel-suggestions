## Neightbours

### Monti
We stayed in an airbnb in Monti niehgbourhood. Small streets, some vintage clothing shops, some nightlife of ppl of our age. It is close to Colosseo and can reach other main sights by walk.
- Vintage clothing Pifebo
- called King Size vintage
- The Sanctuary Eco Retreat, http://www.thesanctuaryroma.it/, some kind of Tulum-ish big club. We went there at night. Outdoor, interesting. A bit yappy posh.

----

### Garbatella
My sister was living there. It's a quiet residential neighbourhood. It used to be low class, but now it's gentrifying. Kind of bushwich / park slope
- We walked around till Pizza Eurosia, which was featured in an old movie and in Anthony Bourdain episode. He supposedly ate here https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1191220-r97602472-Ristorante_Roma_Sparita-Rome_Lazio.html. We didn't eat here.

----

### Pigneto
Pigneto is another up and coming neighbourhood a bit far out. We explored it a bit one evening. It has some nightlife. Think of it like bushwick.
- We stopped for some sandwitches here and really enjoyed it https://foursquare.com/v/opulentia/4da75b731e72d9bb472e0642. 
- We stopped for some coffee at Bar Necci https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d1938754-Reviews-Necci_dal_1924-Rome_Lazio.html

----

### Trastevere
Very active at night. We walked a bit around. Lots of bars. Very busy.
- freni e frizioni - near piazza trilussa in trastevere, also nice for hanging out outside/drinking. We went there for Aperitivo in the early evening. Very busy.
- bir & fud - what it says, good, in trastevere, we didn't go
- Da Teo also v good hostaria in Trastevere, we didn't go

----

### Palazzo dei congressi / EUR, palazzo della civiltà’ italiana
We didn't go there. Fascist architecture

----

### Testaccio
- Felice a Testaccio is meant to be the best hostaria (Roman food). Chiara raccomended it to us. We went there, food was good. A bit posh and hard to get a table. Next to us there was seated a famous italian tv showman, whom my dad was bitching about just few hours earlier.
